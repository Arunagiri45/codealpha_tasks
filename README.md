CodeAlpha Internship â€“ Task Submissions ðŸš€

Welcome to my project repository for the CodeAlpha internship program! This collection showcases beginner-friendly Python projects I completed to fulfill the internship requirements. Each task helped me enhance my coding skills and gain hands-on experience with practical programming challenges.

Tasks Completed âœ…

Task 1 â€“ Hangman Game ðŸŽ®  
A fun and interactive terminal-based word guessing game. The player tries to guess a hidden word by guessing letters one at a time. You get six wrong attempts before the game ends. This project demonstrates my understanding of loops, conditionals, and string manipulation in Python.

Task 4 â€“ Basic Chatbot ðŸ¤–  
A simple rule-based chatbot that interacts through the terminal. It responds to greetings, answers basic questions, and gracefully handles unknown inputs. The chatbot allows polite exit commands like "bye", "exit", or "quit". This project showcases basic input handling, control flow, and user interaction.
